# MR_CellPusher
ttracker and control code for cell pusher algorithm

pyuic5 Cellpusher.ui -o gui_widgets.py

The idea was for the software to generate 2 masks, one for cells and one for microrobots. Then we could track them sperately and create an algorithm to automatically move a cell using a microrobot.
